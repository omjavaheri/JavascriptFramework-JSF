# JavascriptFrameworks-JSF-
in This project, i saved all the required JavaScript functions. in all programming, I came to the conclusion that I should call a public class in my project, and this class should have all the standard code and functions required in JavaScript so that I could easily use these functions wherever necessary. Due to the scope and need to manage this class, I decided to create this class as an object that has high flexibility.

**JSF** is stands for **JavaScript Framework**
you can call JSF just by enter this code in web page header

```<script src="JSF.JS " type="text/javascript"></script>```
